                <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
                
                <p>Our goal is to provide a weather service that is accurate up to date, and easy to use for everyday people.</p>

				<h2>Audience</h2>
				    
				<p>The audience for a weather website would be just about anyone that would need real-time, up tp date weather informoation, from the commuter to a college student, to a parent driving a child to school. The age range for the site would be from twelve to seventy-five. We anticipate our users to use the mobile site more often than the web browser version. Anticipated time of use would be early in the morning before our users leave thir respective homes. </p>

                </ul>
                <p>Weston is a driven, goal oriented buisinessman and has been at his company since he graduated college and has since climbed the corporate ladder to a senior vice president position. He has an hour and a half commute in his car to get to his office from the suburbs. The environment for Weston is either at his office on a high rise or in his car getting to and from work."</p>

                <h3>Peer Review</h3>
            <p>Review by Jake Hester.I really liked your desktop layout! I felt like maybe it didn't transfer that well to your tablet layout. You should try to make it more consistent and better looking on your tablet. The phone version was good. I think the only thing that needs revising was the tablet.</p>
